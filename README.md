# ImageSearcher in develop

Need some refactoring

Code-style Pet-project.

For building project you need to create apikeys.properties with 2 values "unsplash.AccessKey" and "unsplash.SecretKey".
Communicate with me or create own in [a link](unsplash.com)

Tasks:
1) Create Model Layer with Paging (ready)
2) Create Photos List Screen (ready)
3) Create Favourite List Screen (ready)
4) Create About Photo Screen (maybe later)
5) Create Searching (maybe later)
6) Customize UI (maybe later)
7) Add filters and other features (maybe later)
